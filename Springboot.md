## Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA provides repository support for the Java Persistence API (JPA). It eases development of applications Implementing a data access layer.

Implementing a data access layer of an application has been cumbersome for quite a while. 
Too much boilerplate code has to be written to execute simple queries as well as perform pagination, and auditing.

Spring Data JPA aims to significantly improve the implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount thatâ€™s actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.
